# About Me

I'm xo, a game developer from Ottawa, Canada living now in Woodinville, WA, USA.

I like to work on game engines, retro games, and occasionally embeded projects and web games. I raise chickens and build things with wood and metal.

🪧 Note: I have my own git server and rarely interact with GitHub anymore. Because of this I may be slow to respond here.
