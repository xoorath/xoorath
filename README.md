# About Me

I'm Jared (xoorath online) and I'm a game developer from Ottawa, Canada living now in Redmond, WA, USA.

In my work life I like to think of myself as a game engine programmer, and as a hobbiest I like to work on game engines, retro games, 
and occasionally embeded projects and web games.

At the time of writing I'm working on [Lateralus](https//github.com/xoorath/lateralus) a game engine I'm making to explore using C++ modules and conan. 
It's not uncommon for me to spin up little toy engine projects like this to learn a new skill - so by the time you read this I may be on to my next one.
